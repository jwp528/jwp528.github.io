                <p>
                    I'm Josh Parsons. A Freelance web developer living in London ON. I built this site to showcase my skills
                    and make it easier for people to find me. I started building my skills back in 2011 when I started the
                    IWD (Internet Applications and Web Development) program at Fanshawe College. Since then I've graduated from
                    that program and am currently trudging my way through the CPA (Computer Programmer Analyst) program.

                <h1>Work Hard. Play Harder.<img src="resources/img/nes.png" alt="Game On"/></h1>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working on my showcase here or doing school work you can normally find me at one of a few places:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The closest Tim Hortons</li>
                        <li>Hanging with my friends</li>
                        <li>Chilling at home</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I describe myself as more laidback and easygoing, but that doesn't affect my work ethic. I value my line of work,
                    and it shows in the time and energy I put into everything I do.
                </p>
                <h1>Need Code? I'm Your Guy!<img src="resources/img/thumbs.png" alt="Game On"/></h1>
                <p>
                    If you're currently searching for a freelancer to help you with your programming needs. I'm definitely your guy.
                    Listed here is a resum√© of languages, skills and programs that I've learned to use over the years, as well as a gallery of
                    things I've built.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So stick around a while and take a look at what I have to offer, and who knows? Maybe we'll get the opportunity
                    to work together one day.
